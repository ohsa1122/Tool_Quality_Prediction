# Tool_Quality_Prediction


This project predicts quality of tools used in a process called ultrasonic metal welding. There are 2 tools whose conditions are being predicted, anvil and horn, and there are 4 labels corresponding to the quality of tools (new/new, new/worn/ worn/new, worn/worn). The predictions are made using 4 types of time-series signal data.
