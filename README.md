# Tool_Quality_Prediction


This project predicts the quality of tools used in ultrasonic metal welding. There are 2 tools whose conditions are being predicted, the anvil and the horn, and there are 4 labels corresponding to the quality of tools (new/new, new/worn/ worn/new, worn/worn). The predictions are made using 4 types of time-series signal data. There are two files here that show implementations of different models used to make the predictions: the RNN model and the LSTM model.

Data is not included for privacy.
